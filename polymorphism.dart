/*
*Poly means many and morph means forms. Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. As humans, we have the ability to take on many forms. We can be a student, a teacher, a parent, a friend, and so on. Similarly, in object-oriented programming, polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In Dart, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and interfaces.
