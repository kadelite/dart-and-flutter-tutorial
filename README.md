Dart and Flutter Tutorial
This repository contains beginner-friendly Dart programs covering basic concepts and interactions in Dart. Each file demonstrates fundamental Dart features and how to interact with users via the console.

Files Overview
calculator.dart
A simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user for two numbers, lets them select an operation, and prints the result. Built-in error handling ensures invalid inputs and division by zero are addressed.

if.dart
Demonstrates the use of if-else conditionals in Dart. The program prompts the user for their age and prints whether they are old enough to vote (18+), showing different messages based on the input.

online.dart
A user profile builder that collects a user's name, age, and hobbies (entered as a comma-separated list). It displays a formatted summary of the user's information, showing how to process and display input as a list.

Usage
Make sure you have the Dart SDK installed.

Run each file using the command:

text
dart <filename>.dart
Follow the console prompts.

These scripts are designed as learning exercises for anyone starting with Dart programming or preparing for Flutter development.
